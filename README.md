# Ignite Firebase Plugin

###THIS PLUGIN IS STILL IN VERY EARLY STAGE. USE AT OWN RISK.

This plugin adds [react-native-firebase](https://github.com/invertase/react-native-firebase)
to your [Ignite](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite) React Native project and
configures it so it works out of the box with Ignite projects.

## Usage
First go through [initial setup](http://invertase.io/react-native-firebase/#/initial-setup) and get the GoogleService-Info.plist and google-services.json files ready and in the correct places. After that run:


```
$ ignite add firebase
```

This adds `ignite-firebase`.
